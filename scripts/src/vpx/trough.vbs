'  Drain, Trough, and Ball Release
'*******************************************
' It is best practice to never destroy balls. This leads to more stable and accurate pinball game simulations.
' The following code supports a "physical trough" where balls are not destroyed.
' To use this, 
'   - The trough geometry needs to be modeled with walls, and a set of kickers needs to be added to 
'	 the trough. The number of kickers depends on the number of physical balls on the table.
'   - A timer called "UpdateTroughTimer" needs to be added to the table. It should have an interval of 100 and be initially disabled.
'   - The balls need to be created within the Table1_Init sub. A global ball array (gBOT) can be created and used throughout the script
