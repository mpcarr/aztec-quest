*Prologue:*
In the heart of the dense Mexican jungle, a group of intrepid explorers, led by the fearless Dr. Emily Thornton, embarked on a perilous journey in search of the legendary Aztec treasure. Armed with ancient maps and guided by local legends, their quest began.

As they ventured deeper into the lush, unforgiving wilderness, the explorers encountered numerous challenges. The jungle seemed to conspire against them with its thick undergrowth, treacherous terrain, and the ever-present threat of venomous creatures. Yet, their determination and unwavering belief in the treasure's existence kept them going.
The journey tested not only their physical endurance but also their camaraderie. Friendships were forged, and trust was deepened as they relied on each other for support. Dr. Thornton's expertise in deciphering ancient texts proved invaluable, while Antonio, a skilled archaeologist, unearthed small relics that hinted at the treasure's proximity.

After months of toil, they reached a hidden valley, shrouded in mist. At its center lay an ancient temple, its entrance concealed by time and nature. With bated breath, they entered, illuminating the dark chambers with their torches. The walls were adorned with intricate Aztec carvings, telling the story of the treasure's origin.
Deep within the temple, they discovered a chamber unlike any other. A treasure trove of gold, jewels, and artifacts sparkled in the dim light. Dr. Thornton's eyes glistened as she realized that the legends were true. This was the lost Aztec treasure they had sought.
As they gazed upon the magnificent riches of an ancient civilization, the explorers felt a profound sense of accomplishment. Yet, their reverence for history compelled them to document and preserve the treasure rather than claim it for themselves.

Their journey home was laden with the weight of their discovery, both physical and emotional. The Aztec treasure, once lost to time, would now be shared with the world, a testament to the courage, determination, and respect for the past that had brought this group of explorers together.

*Table Features*

the playfield represents the journey through the jungle, a full plunge launches the ball round and out the gate on the right side of the table. Each spinner advances the journey (represented by a path on the playfield, lights under the pf will illuminate the journeys progress). As the journey progresses, modes and multiballs will be unlocked.

Each character will be represented on the playfield, inserts next to the characters will show afflications such as injuries, posioned and trapped. These afflications will effect scoring and mode difficulty. If all characters afflictions are full, then the game ends regardless of what ball you are on.

Outlanes / Inlanes

The outlanes could be snake pits, with an antidote insert to represent a ball save. The 4 lanes could spell a word which when complete activates a shot to cure an affliction from a character.

Left Orbit

The left orbit feeds into a subway that ends up at the cave. The cave fires the ball back onto the pf. It can also be diverted to the pop bumbers via a up post.

Left Ramp

Center Ramp

The center ramp is a 180 return to the right flipper.
